<h1>Experiment: Translating marketing to tech advocacy</h1>

<p>During the planning of our MWC presence, I was asked to record a script as a video for people to watch. These videos were meant to show people how to explain certain parts of our offerings to various audiences. Time was short, so <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crDARfc-PMo">I went through the script without altering it</a>.</p>

<p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/crDARfc-PMo?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<p>It was tough going as the script was written as a marketing piece like a press release but not for reading it from a teleprompter. Both have different goals: in a marketing message repeating the core sound bites and being terribly excited is important. When speaking to a developer audience, you need to tone it down and really get to the meat faster.</p>

<p>In the following exercise I re-wrote the script to flow better when spoken and altered the tone to be more fitting to the intended audience. This is not a criticism of the original materials, but a reminder to be aware of the need to translate to different audiences in different ways.</p>

<p>The explanations on the original text should be seen as coming from a tainted, grumpy and disillusioned developer with an aversion to marketing. The explanations on the replacement texts should be seen as an addendum to explain why the wording was changed.</p>

<h2>Step 1: The re-write</h2>

				This starts a bit too excited. Of course the speaker is excited. It defines opportunities as exciting (which opportunities are by default). It also repeats the complex term "Firefox Marketplace" twice and then assumes that the audience is a developer or content provider and will "learn" by watching this video. 
			</td>

				You start with who you are, the "this is why what's following is legit, as I know this". You then explain who you are talking to and what will happen in the next few minutes.

You get the benefits of simple web publication and a familiar interface for end users.</blockquote>

				More repetition of "Firefox Marketplace". This is product placement, not explaining what it is. It assumes people have heard of it - which is presumptuous. Then we get to the meat: out of a sudden this is about developing open web apps. Why not lead with this? It is also presumptuous to tell people that you will help them understand.

With Firefox Marketplace, Mozilla has created an entirely open app store for HTML5 apps, which we believe is leading the future of the mobile web.</blockquote>

You neither have to pay to list your application nor need to download an SDK or development environment. We made app distribution and consumption as easy as publishing on the web. As you can convert HTML5 to native code, you can even support closed alternatives like iOS and Android.</blockquote>

				That first sentence is a book, not a sentence. It needs massive shortening. It also sounds weirdly "oh we know your pain" which can sound condescending - especially when I had these issues. It then lashes out at other marketplaces without explaining why. How are closed app stores a "blow to innovation and creativity" when the most played games are bought there? It ends with a vague explanation of what Mozilla did and then calls it the future of the mobile web, which sounds very ambitious.
			</td>

				Bam, bam, bam. Why is the marketplace different, what issues of other app stores do we fix, how do you get started? And we end with "nothing is lost, you can cover the other markets, too."

But developing native apps for multiple platforms requires a big time and cost investment.  Often, this requires paying for multiple engineers and developers. Even after the apps are developed, keeping up with ongoing updates and optimization across multiple devices is an ongoing cost that can really add up.</blockquote>
			</td>
			<td>
				<blockquote>Reaching the largest amount of users is a great idea when you publish an app. This means that you can not expect all the people who want to use your app to have a certain device or platform. That's why you have a choice: either build one app for each platform or start with HTML5, and convert it to the others. Using HTML5 means you can cut down on initial engineering cost. Maintenance doesn't mean you have to keep various versions of your app on different platforms in sync. Adding new features means changing one code source. You can keep one core team of developers instead of having to hire specialists for each platform. You can innovate faster without spending a lot of money.</blockquote>

HTML5 apps can also be easily ported into native apps for other app stores, including Apple’s app store and Google Play, using third party tools such 
		   as Phonegap. In short, developing for the web makes it much faster and easier to go cross-platform, and the cost of creating and maintaining your applications is reduced.</blockquote>

				"In short" is a warning sign. It probably means you said too much and too many complex things beforehand. This paragraph makes many assumptions and then goes into the telesales pitch of "it is as easy as pressing a button". Also, "synthetic APK" is something from Star Trek, right? Explain your special features. Nothing is as easy as pressing a button.

HTML5 apps work the same way. Modern web technology allows us to build experiences that work like native apps but are independent of device and platform. As an example, let's look at Chatspaces, a social messaging app built in HTML5. As you will see, it looks and feels just like any other app, but works on Desktop, Android and Firefox OS.

Reminding people how web sites work and explaining that apps are not really that different beasts is a good idea as there are a lot of prejudices towards HTML5.

Second, developers have a big first-mover advantage here in terms of getting their apps discovered. It’s no secret that the two biggest app stores – Apple and Android—have millions of apps which makes it difficult to make a big splash, especially as a newcomer. Firefox Marketplace is the newest app store an therefore a far less crowded space for both consumers and developers. Firefox is using this opportunity to transform the app discovery process with more personalization than ever, which means your apps will be promoted to the users that will love them the most. For example, our new Marketplace Feed matches customized content and theme-based app collections around popular local and global events, like the World Cup. Other collections are based on recommendations from the local community.

App markets based on reviews and ratings are easy to game and there is already an existing spam problem. Seeing that the Firefox Marketplace is still growing we wanted to avoid the mistakes of the past. That's why we researched new ways to promote apps to the target audiences. Apps interesting to the geographic and cultural environment get promoted in Marketplace Feeds. Marketplace Feeds collect apps around popular events, interests and locales. For example there will be World Cup app bundle to get all the important football apps in one step. This means people have to search less and get more and your app can piggy-back on the success of similar apps.

				Both in two ways? Must be a typo. The first point is made, but not really understandable. It basically says "people want different things"? The second argument is a bit of a weird passive aggressive one: as a cynical developer I can see this as a way to hide the fact that other market places than the big ones aren't having enough apps. An empty concert hall is far less crowded. That doesn't mean the band is better. Towards the end it gets interesting. Here come the things that could make a difference for developers.

					The truly amazing thing about Firefox Marketplace is that while we don’t know what’s best for users in your country, we’re tapping into a massive community of local volunteers who do - and they’re helping surface relevant content in a way that’s never been done before. As a developer, you probably already know that it’s well and good to have great local content,  but without a way to surface it, it doesn’t offer much value to either developers or users. We recognize this has been a huge challenge for other app stores, so that’s why we’ve created an entirely new app discovery experience with Firefox Marketplace. Finally, if you’re interested in publishing to Firefox Marketplace, we do feature and promote apps to our massive base of Firefox users through our website, social media, events, newsletter and more.

					Finding relevant content for foreign markets is an issue. Many times the developers of an app are not from the same cultural background as the audience. The worst thing you can do then is make assumptions. Mozilla is in the lucky position to have volunteers from all over the globe who help triaging and promoting relevant apps. That way you get the local know-how instead of having to guess what people in a certain markets want. Feeds and app bundles are one way of finding these apps. The real game changer in Firefox OS is that users can find apps entering their likes and needs. For example entering "football" as a search term will find apps that deal with the sport relevant to the country. In Brazil I get a different app result than I'd get in England. That way our volunteers help local users get the best results possible. The community can then promote the app through our website, social media, events, newsletter and more.

<h3>Final script</h3>

<p>Hello, I am Billy McDougal, Product Marketing Manager of the Firefox Marketplace at Mozilla. I want to show you what Firefox Marketplace offers content providers and developers.</p>

<p>The Firefox Marketplace solves the problem of finding open web applications written in HTML5. Much like closed App Stores, you can list your applications, sell them and get comments and ratings from visitors. </p>

<p>We can promote your application and users of Firefox OS devices or the browser can find and install applications in one place. You get both the benefits of simple web publication and a familiar interface for end users.</p>

<p>The Firefox Marketplace is an open store for HTML5 apps without the restrictions of closed systems:</p>

<li>Visitors can buy apps using carrier billing or pre-paid SIM card. </li>
<li>You neither have to pay to list your application nor need to download an SDK or development environment. </li></ul>

<p>In essence, we made app distribution and consumption as easy as publishing on the web. As you can convert HTML5 to native code, you can even support closed alternatives like iOS and Android in a second step.</p>

<p>When you publish an app it should be obvious that you want to reach the largest amount of users. This means that you can not expect all the people who want to use your app to have a certain device or platform. </p>

<p>That's why you have a choice: either build one app for each platform or start with HTML5, and convert it to the others. </p>

<p>Using HTML5 means a few things: </p>
